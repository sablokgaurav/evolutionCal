# evolutionCal
A evolutionary function in ruby which given a similarity score means the number of the similar bases and the dissimilar bases and then the sequence rate and the divergence rate calculates a ratio which can tell us how much sequencing depth to be covered.

```
evolutionCal(0.2, 34, 186, 0.2)
This functions calculates the sequence similarity
         between the aligned sequences based on the orthology assignment
         Given a sequencerate,similarity among the sequences, dissimilarity
         among the sequences and an evolutionary_divergence, it gives the
         value which tells the similarity score
